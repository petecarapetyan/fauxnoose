# Faux Noose

Comedic satire on dopamine addiction, and how to be an Australian billionaire by leading giant swaths of the population around by the dopamine equivalent of their short-hairs.

## Why Faux Noose?

Dude! Some people appear as transparent and shameless in their motives. That can makes satire hard to resist, at times. Especially when they are so ravenously successful at it, financially.

_You can't fix stupid,_ but the right guy can sure enough make a few billion dollars off of it.

## Why Lorem Ipsum content?

Look, this whole site is a 15 minute affair for me. These sites are that easy to create. Not much thought went into it, initially.

So I just populated with Lorem Ipsum style content, since I can do that with a generator.

I'll probably replace one or more pieces of content one at a time, as the spirit moves.

## To submit satirical content

- Submit a PR with the relevant Markdown content
- Track me down and send me a text content, or better yet - a Markdown file, such as an `blah.md`

Don't expect a fast response, but that doesn't reflect my appreciation for any added comic content. I just gotta pay my rent, first.
