# Blame || 10

We always start here, and so should you!

Concerned with pesky doubts and observations that challenge your beliefs, and even what's directly in front of you?

Simply fire your dopamine circuits by blaming people that are not like us! _**Disabling depression becomes empowering anger,**_ and we can rail together against all _**those people**_ who might be different than _**us**_.

Feel good! Be angry!

Note: Blame also works as a perfect foil for anyone who would challenge our motives. _**"They do it too!"**_, and it doesn't even matter who "they" is. So there you have it. We are blameless. _[Q.E.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.E.D.) Proof_
